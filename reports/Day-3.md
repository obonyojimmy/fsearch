   Identified and resolved issues in the Rabin-Karp search algorithm to ensure accurate full-line string matching.  
1. **Debug and Fix KMP Search** (1 hour):  
   Debugged and fixed the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) search algorithm for reliable full-line string matching.  
1. **Debug and Fix Aho-Corasick Search** (1 hour):  
   Corrected errors in the Aho-Corasick search algorithm to enhance its string matching capability.  
1. **Run Benchmarking with Auto-generated Random Samples from Sample File** (1 hour):  
   Conducted performance benchmarking using randomly generated samples from a sample file to evaluate algorithm efficiency.  
1. **Update Entrypoint Console Script** (1.5 hours):  
   Enhanced the entrypoint script to support positional subcommands (`benchmark`, `start`, `stop`, `client`, `test`) with their respective arguments.  
1. **Implement Client Module** (1 hour):  
   Developed the `client.py` module to facilitate client-server communication.  
1. **Connect Client Module to Entrypoint and Implement Client Tests** (0.7 hours):  
   Integrated the client module with the entrypoint and created tests to ensure functionality, followed by debugging the server/client interaction.

### **2\. Challenges**

1. Debugging the complex string search algorithms to ensure they match the full string in a line was time-consuming.

### **3\. Obstacles and Questions**

1. No current obstacles. All tasks are proceeding as planned.

### **4\. Proud Work Showcase**

**1\. Project Structure**:

* **Difficulty**: Ensuring a well-organized and scalable project structure.  
* **Thought Process**: Focused on creating a modular structure that separates concerns and facilitates ease of development and testing.  
  **2\. Benchmark Module**:  
* **Difficulty**: Ensuring the benchmark module accurately measures performance across various algorithms.  
* **Thought Process**: Focused on creating a robust benchmarking system that can handle diverse test cases efficiently.  
  **3\. Running Server and Client**:  
* **Difficulty**: Ensuring seamless communication between the server and client modules.  
* **Thought Process**: Worked on integrating the client module with the server. Enhanced the package's console entrypoint to support launching the server and client using the `start` and `client` subcommands, respectively. Extensively tested and debugged to ensure reliable interaction and smooth operation.
